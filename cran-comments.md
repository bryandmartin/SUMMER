## Version 0.1.0 Checks

Result: NOTE 
    Package suggested but not available for checking: ‘INLA’ 
    
INLA is not held in a common repository so package so cannot be made available for checking.

checking re-building of vignette outputs ... [2s/3s] WARNING
Error in re-building vignettes:
  ...
Installing package into '/home/hornik/tmp/R.check/r-release-gcc/Work/build/Packages'
(as 'lib' is unspecified)

We added the vignette output to inst/doc. We also have switched to a static vignette, but with source code available and shown.

## Version 0.2.0 Update

* We expanded authorship of the package.
* We updated the links for URL and BugReports.
* We reworked our vignette.
* We added the capability to use a yearly model. Previously, only 5-year increments were possible.
* We changed the plotting function aesthetics and adjusted for the new yearly model. 
* We renamed our included data, added another data set, and clarified that the data do not represent any real country.
* We added the capability to do a simpler model that uses only binary outcome.
* We made minor updates to the documentation and examples.
* Add vignette to inst/doc to prevent WARNINGs.
* Switch to static vignette with source code available and shown so that INLA does not need to be installed.
