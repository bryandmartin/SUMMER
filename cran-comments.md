  New submission

  Suggests or Enhances not in mainstream repositories:
    INLA 
  Availability using Additional_repositories specification:
    INLA   yes   https://www.math.ntnu.no/inla/R/stable
  
**Response:** The first part does not seem to be an issue. For the latter, the INLA repository is included in Additional_repositories.

* Files ‘README.md’ or ‘NEWS.md’ cannot be checked without ‘pandoc’ being installed.

**Response:** I can remove this NOTE by adding README.md file to .Rbuildignore, but I don't think I should do this.

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Spatio (3:8)
  spatio (9:63)
  
**Response:** The word spatio is not misspelled. It is part of the hyphenated word spatio-temporal.

**Response:** Waiting for paper to be ready before resubmission.
